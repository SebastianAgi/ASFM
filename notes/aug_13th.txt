Important to include in thesis: Crowdbot (or IAN) found that interactions are important in social navigation ... Spot doesn't show any interactive actions apart form walking so there is that missing/not enablng it to do better social navigation.

Completely forgot about spot meeting wall will/should enable it to stop and wait a certain time.

spot is a holonomix robot (or at least for this usecase it is) (so change all omni-drectional to holonomic ;) )

Being able to categorize an obstacle was done before with interpreting sensor input such as lazer scan shapes, temperature, but here in this thesis the NN model using the camera feed will accurately identify all humans in the visible scene.

Possible thesis title: A robot pedestrian

Kruse say that a robot has mainly 4 challenges when it comes to robots navigating amongst humans.

To understand status quo and what methods are being used now, what motivated the research into the now used fields is important to understand the full hollistic view of social navigation.

test if follow works with social force no longer ignored. 

Put in that if noone is around stop following leader
put in that if leader is standing still for more than 2-3 sec then unfollow


A strong assumption in the thesis:
"Most tracking methods make the assumption that each pedestrian's motion is independent, thereby ignoring the complex and important interaction between subjects."

future work would quite possibly be to enable crowd analysis like [core_chall:143]

143 could not be used as code or model with trained probabilistic behavior was not available

instead of ratio maybe just add the backwards force to the side that is moving

mention that when people start walking the width (for low speed) gets narrower because when people hav a direction spot can be allowed to come closer as the probability for were they will be in the near future is higher (most likely a position linear to the direction of their velocity)
